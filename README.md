# MyTest — Basic PHP Website

Run with XAMPP (Windows):

1. Start Apache in the XAMPP control panel.
2. Put the `mytest` folder inside `htdocs` (already done).
3. Visit http://localhost/mytest/ in your browser.

Files:
- index.php — Home
- about.php — About
- contact.php — Contact form
- header.php / footer.php — Layout includes
- styles.css — Basic styling

This is a minimal example; for production, add proper validation, CSRF protection, and email sending.
